### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Niv Yarmus.

I am a high school graduate from Herzhog High school, Kfar Sava.
I finished school with a total GPA of 95.
In school I majored in Computer Science, Computational models and Physics
I am a 12th grade student, majoring in Coumputer Science and Physics.

In 2020 I participated in the CodeGuru Extreme tournament, got 8th place.
In 2021 I participated in the CodeGuru Extreme tournament, got 2nd place.

In 2021 and 2022 I hosted the "White Night" (Cryptix) project in my school.
The "White Night" project is a night in which students learn a bunch of encryptions and encoding, equal to 3 months of school studying, in 1 night.
As the host my job was to:
1. Write the code for the challenges.
2. Learn and explain the encoding and encryptions to the students and other mentors.
3. Walk around a class of 50-ish students all night and help anyone who was struggling.
